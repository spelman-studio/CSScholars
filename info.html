The development and maintenance of these systems with all of the data and servers they entail has been massively energy intensive (Kumar). Data centers, or physical facilities which store and manage information for communications technology, account for a collective 2-3% of greenhouse gas emissions (Kumar). Though the environmental impact of data centers fueling AI itself has not yet been massive, as systems such as ChatGPT and Midjourney continue to gain mainstream appeal and usage the carbon footprint of AI will see exponential growth (Kumar).

The abundant and fast-changing data of finance can be analyzed and managed with a speed and efficiency no human is capable of when AI is put into play (Desai).

An increasingly large call has been made to adopt a “human-centered” approach to the usage of AI in education, with students and teachers alike utilizing it as a tool to enhance their own works and ease searches for information and data as opposed to using it as a replacement for developing original work (UNESCO). Some believe that the use of AI in education will better prepare students for a world where it is becoming an increasingly dominant tool, as well as equipping them to develop informed opinions on issues of human rights and human-machine relationships as these AI models continue to become more advanced.

Many have questioned whether these images even constitute artwork, given that they are not created by human artists (Mineo). These images also raise questions about ethics and copyright, given that AI must be trained on some kind of input in order to be able to generate these works (Mineo). Thus, the question arises whether AI being trained on copyrighted works should be considered an infringement of the aforementioned copyright. From a more philosophical standpoint, there have been concerns that using AI in this manner will prove detrimental to human culture on a larger scale, given that AI is at most only capable of mimicking pre-existing work and does not possess the human emotion, innovation, and adaptability that results in the creation of many new works. Most AI art work is currently a collection of stitched together visual tropes and conventions, and has not advanced to a point of significant originality (Mineo). Concerns have been raised, however, that this state is not far off given its rapid development (Mineo). AI in art poses risks for artists and consumers alike (Mineo).</h4></span></div>
